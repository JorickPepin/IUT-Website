# IUT-Website

First experience in **HTML/CSS**.

## Project 

The aim of this first semester project was to create a **communication support** for my school. \
I chose to use HTML/CSS languages rather than a CMS in order to consolidate the basics I learned during my schooling. I took advantage of this project to take my first steps in **JavaScript**.

## Limits

This website is **not responsive**.
